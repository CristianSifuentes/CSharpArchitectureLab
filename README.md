## 📌 Course Overview

This course is structured to progressively build **strong foundations in C#**, followed by **object-oriented programming**, **LINQ**, **file handling**, and finally **ASP.NET Core Web APIs**.

By the end of the course, you will have built:

- A **Console-based Task Manager (TaskMaster)**
- A **RESTful API using ASP.NET Core**
- Real-world CRUD operations with JSON persistence

---
